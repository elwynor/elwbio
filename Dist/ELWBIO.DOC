 WHAT IS BIORHYTHM?

 Biorhythm charts your daily biorhythmic behavioral patterns over a thirty
 day period in an easy to read ANSI output.
 
 GAMEPLAY
 
 Simply enter your birthday (Month, Day, Year) and watch the chart.  
 
 The median line (0) is your "Critical" point and is when you are most 
 prone to accidents or bad luck.  During the "High" periods (+), you are 
 the most energetic and will have better luck than usual.  "Low" periods 
 (-) are times when you have no ambition, and will experience the worst 
 luck.

 GRAPH SYMBOLS

 I ... Median Line        (0)

 C ... Cognitive Cycle    (33-day)
 
 INSTALLATION AND ACTIVATION

 GAME HISTORY
 
 Biorhythm was originally developed in February 1988 by Don Arnel of 
 Logicom (LOG). Logicom closed its doors in 1997, selling the rights 
 to its modules to various other ISVs. Biorhythm was sold to AdventureComm, 
 which was sold to Elwynor Technologies in 2004.
  
 Rick Hadsall of Elwynor Technologies upconverted the module to Worldgroup
 3.2 in 2005, and it was made free software in 2024.

 This version was converted to Major BBS V10 in June 2024.
